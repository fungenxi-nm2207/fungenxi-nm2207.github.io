                <u> <h3> 7 March 2023 </h3> </u>
                <p> I have finally decided on the theme of the game. It would be an adventure/puzzle game, where players will attempt to complete challenges or solve mysteries to move on to the next level. Currently also playing Growtopia again to get some inspiration! xD </p>

                <p> Problems faced: Experimented with different CSS styles. Attempted to code the "flashlight" function for one of my challenges, where players will use their cursors as flashlights to look for clues and escape the dark room.
                    However, after trying it out for about 6 hours, I was only able to create a movable circular cursor, and the contents seemed to be hidden behind the black background. Tried adjusting the z-index, but to no avail. I have decided to instead move on and come up with other challenges instead.
                    <br> <br>
                    New idea: Named the game "the box", to reflect the ups and downs of life. In this game, players will face various obstacles and difficulties, such as having to dodge boxes and clicking on disappearing boxes at the right time. Towards the end of each game, the significance of it will be explained, before moving forward.
                    <br> <br>
                    Progress: Decided on the overall look of my game -- a space themed background, with blinking stars and moving clouds. Thought that it fitted the idea of the box, since once the player escapes "the box", there will be a vast and open universe for them to explore. I also finalised how the game elements are linked to one another, through the buttons. I have also added interesting CSS effects when I hover over the buttons. Upon the click of each button, the game page will transition to another game page, in a fading effect. The explanations of these mechanisms are included in my

                <u> <h3> 24 March 2023 </h3> </u>
                <p> Problems faced: To add interactivity to the game, I have decided to add a user prompt using Javascript, but that function was not showing up correctly. I thought that it was due to the 'prompt' function directly clashing with the 'addEventListener' function that I added to listen for players' clicks to show the hidden page. After talking to Wien about my problem during class, the solution was to add a 'id= introduction' next to my 'div class= introduction'. After reflecting, I realised the problem.
                <br> <br>
                In the JS prompt code, I indicated 'introduction.innerHTML= "hey"... ' The system assumed 'introduction' to be a reference to an HTML element with an ID of 'introduction', in which it will then set the content of that element to the string. By putting only 'div class= introduction' it was not able to 'getElementById' nor use the 'innerHTML' property.      
                <br> <br>
                Progress: Fixed the problem, now looking at classical music and potential game sounds! xD Also currently working on the mechanics of the dodging game -- whether to let the players click according to the music or not.
                <br> <br> <br>
                <u>Q1: What does a game do?</u>
                <br>
                In my game, players will realise that they are trapped in "the box", where the only way to get out is to complete challenges and solve mysteries along the way. Challenges would include dodging obstacles, clicking the right boxes at the right time, and maybe some puzzles, that require users to think out of the box!
                <br> <br>
                <u>Q2: What are the rules it follows?</u>
                <br>
                #Challenge 1: The Box Dodger
                <br>
                The player must control a character using the arrow keys (left and right) to avoid the falling boxes. These boxes might fall at different timings, so it is up to the players to react in time. If the character did not manage to dodge the box in time, the challenge is failed and they must restart again. The player must complete the challenge within a certain time limit to progress to the next challenge. 
                <br> <br>
                #Challenge 2: Seize the opportunity
                <br>
                Player is presented with an empty screen, and have to wait for the boxes to appear and clicking on it before it disappears, within a set target. The players will be presented with other shapes as well, to increase the difficulty level. If the player clicks on another shape (e.g triangle), the player must restart the challenge. 
                <br> <br>
                <u>Q3: What can the user do?</u>
                <br>
                They are forced to restart each challenge until they succeed. They can control their arrows and cursors when playing the game.
                <br> <br>
                <u>Q4: What does the program do for each user action?</u>
                <br>
                Begin game button click: When user clicks the button, the 'startbutton' element is selected when using JS's 'getElementById()' method. An event listener is added to the 'startbutton' element using the 'addEventListener()', which listens for a "click" event. When the user clicks the button, the event listener triggers a function that adds the 'hidden' CSS class to the 'startPage' element and removes the 'hidden' class from the 'gamePage1' element using 'classList.add' and 'classList.remove'. The same mechanic is applied for all of the buttons, when navigating to the next few game pages. However, for the actual game pages, I would put it such that the buttons are only visible after the players complete the challenges.
                <br> <br> 
                Box dodger gameplay: Concepts like arrays and conditional statements ('if') are used. Power-ups such as invisibility and additional points are also implemented using JS. The users interact with it by controlling the character with left and right arrows.
                <br> <br>
                <u>Q5: When does the game end?</u>
                <br>
                It ends when the player successfully completes all the challenges and reaches the end of the game. At the end of the game, there will be a mini interactive statement between me and the user; something similar to "why are you still here?". They are then able to decide whether to restart the game, or exit.

                    <p> Problems faced: A problem is that I am unable to make the player object move to the right, even though there is no problem with the code. I am also trying to make the obstacles move much more smoothly.
                        <br> <br>
                        Progress: I am currently working on the logic of the box dodger game, but I am uncertain whether or not to split up the files, nor how to link the game files together. I have decided not to use an image map, since that is redundant in my opinion. The goal of the box dodger game is to move a character left and right to avoid obstacles moving towards it. Currently, the design of it is such that the box will fall downwards using the concept of cells, but I am also looking at the possibility of it being coming at different directions, and players can use more than the left and right keys. I am really afraid I might not have enough time to complete my game :"" so I will be working on it everyday for Week 12.
                        Nonetheless, I have learnt more new stuff, such as constructor (x, y), and Class to create objects, which is super interesting! I will probably use that for my game.

                    <p> Problems faced: Decided to instead go with the game of dodging bullets. Had many problems, such as being unable to load the content properly, but fixed that through DOMContentLoaded function. Had a problem with how to link the game together as well.
                        <br> <br>
                         Progress: I am currently working on the logic of the game, and have decided to separate the JS files. I faced the problem of being unable to connect both JS together -- the main.js and avoider.js, and tried many methods such as copy-pasting the whole avoider.js code into the main.js file, tried changing the sequence in which the defer src js file was placed, but all to no avail. I might just end up using href to link my pages together. Nonetheless, the logic still feels quite simple, and I am currently thinking of other levels to make my game better. Perhaps, a level that collects the bullets instead and shoots at an opponent? At the very least, I have my CSS and HTML completed, just that the logic of the game might need a little bit of work. I have also looked into export default to try to import 1 JS file to another JS file, but it seemed a little complicated, and I am still figuring that out. I realised that the thing about creating games is that there will always be new ideas and new possibilities; so many things can change in a day! What I initially planned out is now completely different from what I have, which is quite wasted, because I spent so much time working on the box avoider game logic, but ended up needing to remove the whole thing. I have also written out a "script" per se for the narrative of my game. I hope it's interesting enough! Also, I reflected alot about what is the main purpose of my game, and realising that perhaps it is better to focus on depth instead of breath.

                            <p> Problems faced: Bugs kept suddenly coming out from my game out of nowhere. Initially, I set the condition such that only when players collected all 8 coins, they are able to enter the door. Now, without needing to collect all 8 coins, players can still pass the game as well. Another problem I faced is trying to make my narrative come out at the right time, following a particular sequence. I tried using arrays to do that, but it turned out rather difficult to control, since I essentially want 2 lines of text to fade in at different timings, but leave at the same time. This got complicated. There was also the issue of being unable to hide the portals / buttons properly, since most of them were completed using CSS, players will be able to click it even if they did not go through the whole dialogue. I guess that can be a good thing for players, allowing them to skip over long, boring narrative. I also have the problem of restarting the game. Tried creating a new function called resetGame, where a newPLayer is defined to have the initial conditions (0 golds, 3 lives, etc), but it is still not working properly.
                                <br> <br>
                                 Progress: I was able to fix the bug of the door not checking the right conditions before determining if the game condition is true or false. It turned out that I had a minor typo in the code, which flipped the < sign to >, thus made it unable to verify the conditions correctly. As I am trying to make my narrative come out properly at the right time, I am still unable to use arrays to control the animations. Therefore, I ended up defining each line of narrative, calling them by their name in the main.JS file to add interactivity. Furthermore, we ; splitting up the player's narrative and my narrative, since it will be easier to link the "name" that players prompted for people to input. I have also added music to the game, to give it a much more mysterious vibe. </sign>
